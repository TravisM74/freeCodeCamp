        <h2>to the Once Human</h2>
        <p>Once Human is a new sandbox survival game. Unleashed after the opening of a mysterious inter-dimensional silver door, a substance called Stardust has polluted the world, twisting it into a horrific landscape. Following a new style, Once Human combines the rationality in science with the mysteries of the unknown. </p>
        <p>The open-world environment challenges you to survive under the pressure of extreme conditions, otherworldly creatures, and vicious humanity. Gathering resources, building homes, fighting against aberrant monsters, and more make it possible to survive in the wildness. Use lethal weapons and unleash destructive skills to fight your way out.</p>

        <p>Featuring a new weird style, we are committed to creating a unique, grand, and eerie open-world game set in a post-apocalyptic environment. We have endeavored to bring Beyonders into a world ravaged by a horrendous calamity through scenes, characters, narratives, and other elements </p>
        <code>Reality X Environment = Emersion</code>
        <p>It is a future where grotesque monsters and deformed mutations of unknown origins dominate our world, while our civilization, the fruit of human ingenuity, crumbled overnight, succumbing to distorted evolution. The whole environment had been transformed into Impasse due to the Stardust pollution. The new weird genre has been reconciling the contradiction between science’s rationality and unexplored mysteries.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="About_continue">

        <p>However, the endeavor of reconciliation is precisely where the genre’s charm lies, as it keeps swinging back and forth between one end and the other. This becomes our source of inspiration in terms of artistic style. We attempt to bring the products of high-level scientific technologies, representing the absolute rationality of human civilization, the beautifully eerie organisms of unidentified sources, and unnatural phenomena into collision, providing our players with powerful visual spectacles.  </p>
        <code>Dust X Environment = Mutation</code>
        <p>We have great faith in the tenacity of human subjectivity from the outset. Surviving and thriving over the total annihilation wrought by the cataclysm, we believe that humans would eventually develop a new evolution route for biological forms and scientific technologies by exploring the most incredible catastrophe humans have met so far. Hence, our world is comprised of scientific establishments, the Cradle device that contains the aberrant and escalates human physical strength, and the Veil of Tranquility resisting organic pollution that erodes human sanity. This is a ground-breaking era of human evolution.</p>
